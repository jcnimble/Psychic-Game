# Psychic-Game

This project was very disappointing. I did 6 video game tutorials in the hopes of finding the code structure I could adapt and make my own.  If I wasn't so tired, I would submit my gallery of dead-ends.  I was unable to get this to work -- I never got that close.  I really did not feel prepared for this project and did not feel like I was armed with the tools to succeed. I'm not sure this program is really for individuals with basic/beginner skilss.  I have signed up for tutoring, but I do not feel encouraged by the program so far.
